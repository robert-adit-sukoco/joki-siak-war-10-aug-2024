und das heißt: Erika.

## What You Need
- Selenium and Python, this should be fairly obvious if you know basic programming
- Chromedriver according to your browser's version, place it on the same folder as this
- Put the right information inside credentials.txt and matkul.txt, as provided in examples

Just run it after that. Run multiple instances if you want but make sure to monitor each so that they don't get stuck

If you don't know how to use this, that means you probably shouldn't

## Last Tested
Semester Genap 2021/2022 (real war)

## File Information
blitzkrieg.py: Search based on clues that are always on the website, breaks if the system ever changes

bushido.py: Search based on your inputs, breaks if target changes or human error

## Good To Know Stuff
Warning: It can get stuck somewhat due to SIAK's new system. It is advisable to open multiple instances

Tips:
- Read the code first so that you know what it does. You're a programmer, right?
- Make sure everything in matkul is unique to other classes available
- Turn on at least 10 minutes before the war
- Monitor it until it can log in at least once. Continuous login thereafter should pose no trouble until a certain amount of time elapses
- Run multiple of both versions at the same time so at least one can succeed
- Only use this as insurance, manual participation and monitoring is advised
